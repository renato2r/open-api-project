Open API Project - Star Wars

In this project, I implemented a web page where I connect to a public API to retrieve data and display it on the screen for the user. To simulate, the user simply needs to follow these steps:
- 1) Open the index.html file in the browser. A page containing two columns (Characters and Species) will be displayed.
- 2) Choose a character and click on the name. The character's details will be displayed (First endpoint).
- 3) Choose a species and click on the species name. The details about the selected species will be displayed (Second endpoint).
